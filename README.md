# TODO

## Important stuff
~ Statistical tests (t-paired) 
- Attribute selection (only on test-set, inside a meta-classifier)
- Is plot_learning_curve ok?
~ Eval AUC_ROC for all the classifiers!

##Â Extra stuff
- Remove similar articles when building the model (?)
- Try predict likability without category ()
- KNN for suggestions
