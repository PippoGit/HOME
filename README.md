# TODO
- Change slide with performance from regular stratified cross-validation
- Add "Feature Selection" within TF-IDF (slide)
- Add "Independent Feature Selection" and show how it sucks (ADDITIONAL TESTS MAY BE REQUIRED!)
- Add "Paired T-Test" slide
- Show briefly how feature selection works with Bagging (which btw sucks) (slide)
- Remove Learning-Curves
