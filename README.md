**HO**pefully-s**M**art n**E**ws aggregator

RSS Feed news aggregator + some machine learning magic to make it nice.

## TODO
* Try to plot confusion matrix without sorted labels
* Test again StackingClassifier now that i've fixed CV (i guess)
* Tuning XGBClassifier (just a little)
* Fix the model_deploy => Should i trust the score or not? Anyway:
    LC => XGB,
    NC => SVC should be fine
* Powerpoint slides
