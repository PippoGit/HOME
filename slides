* Problem introduction: google news sucks, what can we do about it?

* Overview of the system (schema)
    * News coming from the sources
    * Server (Parser + Features Extraction + Model + To the user)
    * MongoDB (Dataset for training/keep the model updated)

* Preparing the dataset 
    * Feed RSS
    * Parser
    * Cleaning

    * WebApp+Tag
    * Like/Dislike


* Pre-Processing
    * Lowercase
    * Tokenization
    * Stemming/Lemmatization 
    * Ignore Normalized Stopwords

* Features Extraction
    * TF-IDF (basically)

* The Model: The News classifier
    * Simple Classifier with scores
    * Ensemble+Metaclassifier with scores

    * Best classifier + Confusion Matrix

* The Model: The Likability Classifier
    * Simple Classifier with scores
    * Ensemble+Metaclassifier with scores

    * Best classifier + Confusion Matrix

* Conclusion: 
    * Is classifing an article easy? probably not
    * Is 80% accuracy good? No, but it's fair enough.
